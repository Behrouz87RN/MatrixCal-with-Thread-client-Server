I am thrilled to present a comprehensive Unix programming project undertaken at Blekinge Institute of Technology, showcasing proficiency in C programming and delving into crucial concepts such as processes, forking, pthreads, daemons, IO multiplexing, and socket programming. 

Preparation for the project involved a solid grasp of Unix fundamentals, adeptness in C programming, and familiarity with operating system concepts covered in lectures 6â€“10. The project's structural organization adheres to a systematic folder layout, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

The primary objective was crafting a math server capable of solving matrix inversion and k-means clustering problems, leveraging parallelization through Pthreads. The client-server interaction was pivotal, with the server designed to adeptly manage concurrent sessions, mirroring real-world server functionalities.
